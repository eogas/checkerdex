checkerdex
==========

A Chrome extension to notify the user of potential procrastinating or general time-wasting

Checkerdex tracks a list of specified domains (added through the extension's options menu) and uses a
sophisticated algorithm (/s) to notify the user if he or she has been visiting one of the sites on the list
too frequently.  A score of 1 to 10 on the checkerdex scale is given to rate the abuse of free time.
